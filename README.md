# heroku-ocsigen

This is a Dockerfile for deploying the Ocaml [ocsigenserver](https://ocsigen.org) to Heroku as a Docker container.  

It runs the bare ocsigenserver.  Image is 1.35GB.

Live site [here](https://ocsi-app4.herokuapp.com).  I am using the free tier so it takes a while to wake up a dyno if it is sleeping.
